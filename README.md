Description:
Conducted a comprehensive statistical analysis of a real-world environmental 
dataset on Canadian water pollution indicators, including pH, turbidity (NTU), 
and dissolved oxygen levels. The project aimed to assess spatial and seasonal 
variations in water quality across multiple provinces.

ðŸ“ˆ Key Responsibilities & Outcomes:

Cleaned and preprocessed over 10,000 records using tidyverse, converting time 
stamps, handling missing data, and creating a seasonal variable for comparison.

Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualized trends using line plots 
and boxplots (ggplot2) to identify differences in water quality across 
provinces.

Conducted statistical hypothesis testing:

One-way ANOVA to compare turbidity levels across provinces.

Two-sample t-test to evaluate seasonal effects on dissolved oxygen 
levels (Winter vs. Summer).

Applied seasonal decomposition (additive model) to examine trends and 
seasonality in turbidity levels over time.

Built an ARIMA(2,1,2) model to forecast turbidity levels in Ontario, using 
statsmodels for time series analysis.

Interpreted results and documented findings with data-driven insights into 
seasonal patterns and provincial disparities in water quality.# water-quality-statistics-analysis
